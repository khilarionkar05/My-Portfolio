    <h1 class="text">About Me</h1>
    <p class="para">
      From designing an ultrasonic radar system for Sandip University, my journey in <br>
       B. Tech CSE with a specialization in AI & ML is nothing short of thrilling. I'm a second-year <br>
       student at Sandip University, Nashik, who excelled with an A+ grade in my first year. <br>
       My passion for technology is coupled with a knack for practical applications, evidenced <br>
       by projects like the footstep power generator and anti-sleep driving unit. <br><br>

     Programming languages like C, Python, and web technologies such as HTML are tools that <br>
     I employ to bring my innovative ideas to life. Currently, I'm channeling my creativity and <br>
     technical skills into developing an AI bot designed to enhance campus life, alongside <br>
      crafting engaging animation videos. <br><br>

     I firmly believe in the power of technology to transform everyday experiences and am keen <br>
     on exploring opportunities where my skills can contribute to meaningful projects. <br>
      Letâ€™s connect and explore how we can create impactful technology solutions together! <br><br>
